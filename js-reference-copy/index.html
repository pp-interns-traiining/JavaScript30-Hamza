// Team is a reference to the original array (players)

// You might think we can just do something like this:
team[2] = 'hamzy';
// however what happens when we update that array?
// now here is the problem!
// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
// Way of making a copy of a array so it does not point to the same reference.
const team2 = players.slice();
const team3 = [].concat(players);
const team4 = [...players];

// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
// with Objects
const person = {
  name: 'Wes Bos',
  age: 80
};
// and think we make a copy (objects {}):
// const captain = person; //they share same reference point
// captain.number = 99; //this will alter the original reference (person)

// Make a copy without sharing reference points
const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
const captain3 = { ...person };
// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const person2 = {
  name: 'hamza',

    twitter: 'none'
  }

const mate = Object.assign({}, person2);
//poor mans deep clone ?
